to update partition table after you have a working sql query, here's a simple query to get both partition and cluster info:

-- Get partition and clustering info
SELECT 
  table_name,
  ddl
FROM `feisty-outrider-471302-k6.advanced_csv_analysis.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`
WHERE table_name = 'email_domain_results';




(check json for output)
The ddl field will show you the complete table definition including:PARTITION BY DATE(created_at)CLUSTER BY extracted_domain, scraping_status, real_estate, infrastructure
