to update partition table after you have a working sql query, here's a simple query to get both partition and cluster info:

-- Get partition and clustering info
SELECT 
  table_name,
  ddl
FROM `feisty-outrider-471302-k6.advanced_csv_analysis.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`
WHERE table_name = 'email_domain_results';



(check json for output)
The ddl field will show you the complete table definition including:PARTITION BY DATE(created_at)CLUSTER BY extracted_domain, scraping_status, real_estate, infrastructure

===== what is clustering? =====


**What clustering does:**
- **Physically reorganizes data** within each partition based on the clustered columns
- **Groups similar values together** on disk (e.g., all "gmail.com" domains stored near each other)
- **Speeds up queries** that filter, group, or join on those specific columns

**Key points:**
1. **Not related to number of columns** - You could have 400 columns, but clustering only affects how data is physically stored based on the clustered columns

2. **Choose columns you filter/group by most often** - For example:
   ```sql
   WHERE extracted_domain = 'gmail.com'  -- Fast with clustering
   WHERE scraping_status = 'success'     -- Fast with clustering  
   WHERE real_estate LIKE '%commercial%' -- Fast with clustering
   WHERE company_summary LIKE '%tech%'   -- Slow (not clustered)
   ```

3. **Order matters** - BigQuery clusters first by `extracted_domain`, then `scraping_status`, then `real_estate`, then `infrastructure`

4. **Limits** - Max 4 clustering columns in BigQuery

**Example:**
If your app mostly queries:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table 
WHERE extracted_domain = 'company.com' 
  AND scraping_status = 'success'
```

Then `CLUSTER BY extracted_domain, scraping_status` would be perfect because BigQuery can quickly jump to the physical location where that data is stored together.
