to update partition table after you have a working sql query, here's a simple query to get both partition and cluster info:

-- Get partition and clustering info
SELECT 
  table_name,
  ddl
FROM `feisty-outrider-471302-k6.advanced_csv_analysis.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`
WHERE table_name = 'email_domain_results';



(check json for output)
The ddl field will show you the complete table definition including:PARTITION BY DATE(created_at)CLUSTER BY extracted_domain, scraping_status, real_estate, infrastructure

===== what is clustering? =====


**What clustering does:**
- **Physically reorganizes data** within each partition based on the clustered columns
- **Groups similar values together** on disk (e.g., all "gmail.com" domains stored near each other)
- **Speeds up queries** that filter, group, or join on those specific columns

**Key points:**
1. **Not related to number of columns** - You could have 400 columns, but clustering only affects how data is physically stored based on the clustered columns

2. **Choose columns you filter/group by most often** - For example:
   ```sql
   WHERE extracted_domain = 'gmail.com'  -- Fast with clustering
   WHERE scraping_status = 'success'     -- Fast with clustering  
   WHERE real_estate LIKE '%commercial%' -- Fast with clustering
   WHERE company_summary LIKE '%tech%'   -- Slow (not clustered)
   ```

3. **Order matters** - BigQuery clusters first by `extracted_domain`, then `scraping_status`, then `real_estate`, then `infrastructure`

4. **Limits** - Max 4 clustering columns in BigQuery

**Example:**
If your app mostly queries:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table 
WHERE extracted_domain = 'company.com' 
  AND scraping_status = 'success'
```

Then `CLUSTER BY extracted_domain, scraping_status` would be perfect because BigQuery can quickly jump to the physical location where that data is stored together.

Cost Impact:

Reduced scanning - Instead of scanning the entire table (all 400 columns × millions of rows), BigQuery can skip large chunks of data

Lower costs - You'll pay for less data scanned

Faster results - Queries return much quicker


**How to identify what to cluster - analyze your app's queries:**

**Step 1: Look at your most common WHERE clauses**
```sql
-- If your app frequently runs these queries:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john@company.com'
SELECT * FROM users WHERE department = 'sales' AND status = 'active'
SELECT * FROM users WHERE location = 'NYC' AND role = 'manager'

-- Then cluster on: email, department, status, location
CLUSTER BY email, department, status, location
```

**Step 2: Check your JOIN conditions**
```sql
-- If you often join tables like this:
SELECT u.*, o.* 
FROM users u 
JOIN orders o ON u.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE u.region = 'US'

-- Then cluster the users table on: customer_id, region
-- And cluster the orders table on: customer_id
```

**Step 3: Look at GROUP BY patterns**
```sql
-- If you frequently aggregate like this:
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM users 
GROUP BY department, location

-- Consider clustering on: department, location
```

---

**When NOT to cluster / Illegal examples:**

**❌ Don't cluster on:**

1. **High cardinality columns (too many unique values):**
```sql
-- BAD - timestamp has millions of unique values
CLUSTER BY created_timestamp, email, name, id
-- Each "cluster" would have just 1-2 rows, no benefit
```

2. **Columns you never filter on:**
```sql
-- BAD - if you never query these columns
CLUSTER BY description, comments, notes, metadata
-- Waste of clustering, slows down maintenance
```

3. **More than 4 columns (BigQuery limit):**
```sql
-- ILLEGAL - BigQuery allows max 4 clustering columns
CLUSTER BY col1, col2, col3, col4, col5  -- ❌ ERROR
```

4. **Wrong data types:**
```sql
-- ILLEGAL - can't cluster on ARRAY, STRUCT, JSON
CLUSTER BY tags_array, user_struct, json_data  -- ❌ ERROR
```

5. **Frequently changing columns:**
```sql
-- BAD - if last_login_time changes constantly
CLUSTER BY last_login_time, email
-- Constant re-clustering overhead
```

**✅ Good clustering example:**
```sql
-- Your app queries: WHERE email = ? AND status = ? AND department = ?
CLUSTER BY email, status, department, location
-- Low-medium cardinality, frequently filtered, stable values
```

**Pro tip:** Start with your most selective filters first in the cluster order!
